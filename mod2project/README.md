Who is app is for?
This app is a fun lighthearted app for everyone who is interested in their horoscope
For all ages
This app allows the user to find out their daily horoscope as well as their weekly horoscope
It has other fun features like : mood, lucky number, color, lucky time, and compatibility sign
My goal was to create an easy to navigate application that worked with two APIs seamlessly and unknowingly to the user
Technical details:
I used two APIs that utilized class, props, states, and the dot notation
I learned about the NavLink Component. As a special version of the Link Component. It adds styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.
I found it handy when I changed the color of the tabs when clicked
There's always multiple ways to solve a problem in code I notice
Using “exact to” was also helpful to make sure my highlight didn’t stay stuck in one place
One API had really great documentation that helped me with the other one that lacked documentation.
With some basic logic and testing we got the other problematic API to render
Improvements?
I would've love to incorporate more detailed APIs and expanded to every possible horoscope need. Such as yearly, monthly, compatibility profiles between signs, videos etc.
Highlights
Learning what it takes to build an application under the hood gives me a new respect for many of the websites and software I use everyday
I've learned that APIs are everywhere and in nearly everything
They make our jobs so much easier (not so much with implementing them) but with adding a layer of abstraction to our work
In many ways now I see how react is useful in the sense that I do feel more organized than I did typing out HTML in the early days when I first learned how to code
I now open the floor to questions
