Horoscope App:

Who is app is for?


This app is a fun lighthearted app for everyone who is interested in their horoscope!


This app allows the user to find out their daily horoscope and has other fun features like : mood, lucky number, color, lucky time, and compatibility sign.

My goal was to create an easy to navigate Single Page Application that worked with an API seamlessly and unknowingly to the user
